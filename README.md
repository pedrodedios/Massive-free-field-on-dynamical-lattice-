Computation of diffeo-invariant correlation functions on dynamical background

🌟 Overview

This repository contains the numerical codes used in my [thesis][(https://example.com/thesis.pdf](https://www.db-thueringen.de/receive/dbt_mods_00067834)). to study a background-independent toy model consisting of a free massive scalar field defined on a dynamical, irregular one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions.

The lattice geometry is encoded in variable edge lengths, which are weighted by a Gaussian distribution. This setup provides a simplified, spin-foam-inspired model of fluctuating geometry that preserves the essential features of matter–geometry coupling while allowing explicit numerical evaluation.

At the core of the analysis is the relational (diffeomorphism-invariant) two-point correlation function
